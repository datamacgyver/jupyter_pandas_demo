# jupyter_pandas_demo

This repo does a quick intro to how a Jupyter notebook and Pandas can be used for data analysis. To use it you will need: 
* Python installed
* Jupyter installed (pip install jupyter), some IDEs will handle this for you
* By preference a good IDE that will wrap stuff up for you. I use PyCharm but many also use VSCode, the latter of these you just need to install the jupyter plugin. 

Once you've got those bits together, pull this repo and open it in your IDE. You should then be able to open and work with the notebook.
